<h3>New things under development</h3>

<p>Currently there are a lot of issues related to belongsTo/hasMany relationships. <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/data/tree/embedded-records">The guys are working hard on refactoring the relationships.</a></p>

<p>There is also a new router being developed <a href="https://gist.github.com/3981133">https://gist.github.com/3981133</a>, which was merged into master couple days ago. If you still need to use the old router, see recipe on <a href="http://ember-cookbook.github.com/chapters/basics/building_ember_with_the_old_router">building Ember with the old router</a></p>
